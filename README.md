# International Classification for Standards

[International Classification for Standards](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100033.html) (ICS) serves as a structure for catalogues of international, regional and national standards and other normative documents, and as a basis for standing-order systems.

The classification system is modeled using [Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) (SKOS).
